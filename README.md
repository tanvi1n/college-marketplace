# The Student Marketplace App

## The Concept
The Student Marketplace is a mobile-first web application designed to be the official marketplace for students to buy, sell, and swap essential academic and hostel items within their university campus.

## Problem It Solves
This app addresses the high cost of new textbooks, lab equipment, and other academic materials. It also tackles the waste generated when senior students discard items that are still valuable to junior students. It digitizes and secures the traditional senior-junior network, making it more efficient and trustworthy.

## Core Features
*   **Verified Student Community:** Ensures all users are verified students through college email login, creating a safe and trusted environment.
*   **Buy, Sell, & Swap:** Allows students to easily list items for sale or indicate they are open to bartering.
*   **Subject-Based Search:** A tailored search feature that lets students find books and materials by subject name (e.g., "Calculus 101").
*   **In-App Chat:** Secure and direct communication between buyers and sellers.
*   **User Profiles & Ratings:** Builds accountability through transparent user profiles, seller history, and a community-driven review system.

## Tech Stack
*   **Platform:** Android
*   **Language:** Kotlin
*   **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose
*   **IDE:** Android Studio

## Our Vision
To create a sustainable and affordable campus economy where no textbook goes unread, no dorm furniture is wasted, and every student can save money and connect with their peers in a safe, trusted digital space.
