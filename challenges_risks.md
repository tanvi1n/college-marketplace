# Challenges and Risk Factors in a Student-to-Student Campus Marketplace System

## 1. Fake Listings

Students may post misleading or fraudulent listings, including:

* Items they do not actually own
* Old or downloaded images sourced from the internet
* Scam-style listings with unrealistically low prices
* Fake “urgent sale” products designed to pressure buyers

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Listing verification mechanisms
* Image authenticity checks
* Mandatory admin approval or post-review moderation

---

## 2. Last-Minute Cancellations

Both buyers and sellers frequently cancel after confirmation, citing reasons such as:

* Item sold to another person
* Sudden unavailability
* Loss of interest

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* User rating system
* Cancellation history tracking
* Penalties for repeated cancellations

---

## 3. No-Shows During Meetups

Common meetup failures include:

* Sellers not showing up at pickup points
* Buyers ghosting after agreement
* Continuous delays in item pickup

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Scheduled meetup system
* User reliability score based on attendance

---

## 4. Payment Disputes

Payment-related conflicts arise, especially when UPI or external payment methods are used:

* Buyer claims payment was made, but seller denies receipt
* Seller receives payment and blocks the buyer
* Incorrect QR codes scanned by buyers

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Escrow-based payment system
* Restriction to in-person cash or UPI payments at the exchange point

---

## 5. Miscommunication Between Users

Disputes occur due to:

* Incorrect item descriptions
* Different interpretations of condition or usage
* Lack of clarity in chat discussions

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Mandatory condition tags
* Structured photo upload requirements
* Predefined chat templates

---

## 6. Quality and Condition Issues

Sellers may intentionally or unintentionally:

* Hide defects
* Upload misleading photos
* Mislabel items as “like new”

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Post-transaction ratings
* Complaint mechanism
* Video proof support within chat

---

## 7. No Warranty or Return Policies

Unlike commercial platforms, student marketplaces often lack:

* Clear warranty coverage
* Return or replacement policies

This leads to disputes when items malfunction after purchase.

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Explicit “No Warranty” declaration
* Optional limited return window (e.g., 48 hours) for select categories

---

## 8. Identity Fraud

Potential identity-related risks include:

* Use of another student’s email
* Creation of multiple fake accounts
* Anonymous harassment

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Mandatory student email verification
* Device-level account locking
* Administrative identity checks

---

## 9. Inappropriate or Illegal Listings

Students may attempt to sell prohibited items such as:

* Alcohol
* Examination materials
* ID cards
* Illegal substances
* Banned or offensive content

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Content moderation system
* User reporting functionality
* Category-based listing restrictions

---

## 10. Storage and Server Challenges

High image uploads can cause:

* Increased storage costs
* Slow loading times
* Application performance degradation

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Image compression
* CDN integration
* Optimized cloud storage solutions

---

## 11. Safety and Security Concerns

Even within campus environments, risks include:

* Harassment in chat
* Unsafe meetup locations
* Stalking through shared location data
* Inappropriate photo requests

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Designated safe meetup points
* Admin monitoring
* Block and report features

---

## 12. Dispute Handling Between Students

Typical disputes involve:

* Damage during item inspection
* Refusal to pay after pickup
* Circulation of counterfeit currency

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Structured dispute resolution workflow

---

## 13. Multiple Buyers for the Same Item

Common problems include:

* Seller being overwhelmed by messages
* Buyers assuming reservation without confirmation
* Conflicts when item is sold to another buyer

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Time-bound reservation feature
* Automatic listing visibility updates

---

## 14. Low User Engagement After Launch

Post-launch challenges include:

* Users abandoning the app
* Low listing creation
* Preference for existing platforms like WhatsApp or Facebook Marketplace

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Push notifications
* Referral incentives
* Listing visibility boosts

---

## 15. Community Moderation Difficulties

Administrators may struggle with:

* Spam removal
* Dispute resolution
* User bans
* Fair enforcement of policies

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Advanced admin tools
* Automated moderation assistance

---

## 16. Market Saturation of Common Items

Excess listings of items such as:

* Textbooks
* Lab coats

Result in reduced buyer interest.

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Anti-spam and abuse detection systems

---

## 20. End-of-Semester Surge

During semester endings:

* Massive increase in listings
* High buyer demand
* Server load spikes
* Price volatility
* Increased disputes

**Required Mitigation Measures:**

* Scalable backend architecture
* Dedicated “Semester Mode” interface
